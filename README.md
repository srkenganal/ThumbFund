# TaskFund & QuickTask

TaskFund and QuickTask is a decentralized platform built on Solana that allows users to create tasks and fund them with SOL, while workers complete tasks to earn crypto rewards. It's designed to be simple, customizable, and highly versatile for different use cases, such as selecting logos, designs, or thumbnails.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks by funding them with 0.1 SOL or more. Tasks can range from image selection to design reviews or other creative tasks.
- **Worker Platform**: Workers on QuickTask can see the list of available tasks, complete them, and get rewarded in Solana.
- **Crypto Payouts**: Once tasks are completed, workers can withdraw their earned SOL to their Phantom wallet and transfer it to their bank accounts later.
- **Customizable**: The platform is fully open-source and can be customized for various business purposes.

## How It Works

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
- Users connect their Phantom wallet to the platform.
- New users automatically get their account created, while existing users can log in seamlessly.

### 2. Explore Ongoing Tasks
- The dashboard displays ongoing tasks where users can view details such as submissions and likes.

### 3. Create a Task
- Users can create a task by entering details like the task title and uploading relevant images (e.g., thumbnails, logos).
- After task creation, users fund the task by paying 0.1 SOL or more.

### 4. Task Completion by Workers
- Once funded, the task is published on the QuickTask platform.
- Workers complete the task, and the funds are transferred to their account as they finish.

### 5. Withdraw Earnings
- Workers can withdraw their Solana earnings to their Phantom wallet after completing tasks.
