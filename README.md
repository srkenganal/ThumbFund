# ThumbFund
This application allows users to upload thumbnails and offer rewards in Solana for voting on their submissions. Once a task is published, worker users can log in, review the thumbnails, and vote for the most appealing ones. In return, they earn a portion of the Solana rewards, which can later be transferred to their wallets as payouts.
